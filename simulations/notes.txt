Notes on configuration
----------------------

EOS = MJDWF 

Uses LeithQG viscosity
Uses Prather SOM advection
Uses layers for layerwise diagnostics



Notes on simulation
-------------------

After approximately 8 years of model time (possibly only effective after the 10 year restart), changed surface forcing to be 5 degrees further south. Domain goes from 75S to 45S.

This will cause a jump in the time series, but, the model is nowhere near equilibrated, and there's no reason to throw out those years of simulation, since the output will be closer to the final equilibrium than the initial conditions.

After ~100 years, changed the northern sponge condition to include the full depth profiles from WOA. I compressed the vertical axis in the data to make the ~5,000 m profiles fit the 4,000 m deep domain.
